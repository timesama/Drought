This is a tribute to my beloved game Pipe Dream from NES.

The main character Moti the Plumber roams around the neighbourhood and tries to fix the broken pipes.

In the game, the player(s) needs to connect the source(s) with the sink to deploy the water stream with a defined temperature.

The player can place pipes, change the temperature of the source, destroy placed pipes, buy items, fight with an enemy and score points for a long pipe system.

The main feature is the multiplayer mode, since I find this game enjoyable the most when played with friends.

_____

The controls are from the keyboard. WASD, space and enter. The use of items is controlled by pressing 123, the left click of the mouse on the source changes the temperature.

It is possible to play from the phone, but much better from PC, since I didn't invest enough into proper scaling.

_____

The pixelart is handmade.

The main music theme is transcribed from purchased notes; other musical themes are either made by me or transcribed without notes - meaning I know the melody and I can create a midi file myself.

The sounds are recorded by me.

There might be some bugs that I didn't catch or decided to ignore. I am truly sorry for that in advance.
